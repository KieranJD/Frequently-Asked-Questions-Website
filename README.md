ENCRYPT SESSIONS

Basic

This will produce a basic yet functional FAQ system.

~~Without logging in a user can view all the question titles and dates on the homepage.
Clicking on a question title takes the user to a details page where they can see the question details together with any answers supplied by other users.~~
~~If a user logs in they can add new questions. This should include:
        A short title.
        A detailed description of the problem.
        An optional photo or screenshot
If a logged in user views a question details page they will be able to add an answer.~~

Intermediate

This adds some additional functionality.

~~The optional screenshot should be displayed as a low-resolution thumbnail.
Clicking on the thumbnail should display the full-resolution image.
The person who posted the original question can flag one of the answers as the correct one.
~~This correct answer should be flagged on the details page.~~
~~On the home page any question that has a correct answer flag should be indicated as 'solved' on the homepage.~~
Any logged in user can rate any answer that they did not provide on a scale of 1-5 stars.

Advanced

The advanced functionality covers gamification.

Every user start off with a contribution score of 0.
Logged in users can flag answers as off topic or inappropriate. This takes 5 points off the poster's score.
Every answer flagged as correct adds 50 points to the posting person's contribution score.
The best users are flagged with a gold, silver or bronze start:
        The top 5% of users are flagged with a gold star.
        The top 25% are flagged as silver.
        The top 50% are flagged as bronze star users.
